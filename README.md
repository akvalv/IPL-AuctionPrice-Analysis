# IPL-AuctionPrice-Analysis
Predicting IPL Cricket Players' Auction Price and analysing if they are over / under priced.

Research Problem:
-To what extent does an IPL player's social media presence, influence their auction price?
-Does being Player of the match in IPL games influence the auction price of a player?
-Is there a correlation between the age of an IPL player and their auction price?
-Can we find best performance players who are below the Average Auction Price?

Solution:
-Linear regression to predict the Auction Price 
-Exploratory Data Analysis
-Analysis of Regression Plots to see the effect of variables on Auction Price
-Visualization in Tableau to identify Less Paid - High Performance players 

Conclusion:
-Based on analysis, we found that social media presence, age, and player of the match do not have a significant impact on the predicted auction price of batsmen and bowlers in the IPL. This suggests that IPL team owners may not consider these factors when deciding on the auction price of players.
-However, our analysis was based on a relatively small dataset and did not take into account the team's requirements and budget constraints. 
-Therefore, further research is needed to explore other variables that may impact player auction prices and to evaluate the model's performance using additional metrics.

In summary, the analysis provides some insights into the factors that influence the auction price of players in the IPL. However, further research is needed to get a more comprehensive analysis.
